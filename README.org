* Puppet aggregate facts
Created to solve a bug in Puppet Facter, which turned out to not be a bug at
all.

** Usage
#+begin_src sh
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -ft --tail=5
#+end_src

Once it has settled you can start the Puppet agent using the ~up~ command:
#+begin_src sh
docker-compose up -d
#+end_src
